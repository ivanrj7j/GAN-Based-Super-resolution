# GAN-Based-Super-resolution
Implementation of Super resolution models using GANs

## Goals 

- Train a model that can upscale any given image to 4x size
- Implement the [SRGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802) paper
- Feed the depth data to the model for better understanding. Using [MiDaS](https://pytorch.org/hub/intelisl_midas_v2/)

`README.md will be updated based on the results of the project later`
